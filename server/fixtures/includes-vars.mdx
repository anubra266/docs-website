## Installation

Here is a test for including variables in an MDX file.

(!includes/install-version.mdx version="10" unsupported="9" !)

If installation fails, you will see the following error message:

(!includes/error-message.mdx message="Installation has failed!"!)

If installation succeeds, you will see this message:

(!includes/error-message.mdx message="Installation==successful! Type \\"Continue\\" to proceed."!)

After you type "Continue", you will see this message:

(!includes/error-message.mdx message="Type 'next' to see the next screen."!)

After that, you will see this message:

(!includes/error-message.mdx message="Type \\"final\\" to see the final screen."!)

## Supported platforms

### Open Source

(!includes/supported-systems.mdx clouds="AWS and GCP"!)

### Enterprise

(!includes/supported-systems.mdx systems="macOS and Windows"!)

## What about partials where there are no required variables supplied?

We'll show the template variable in case the partial intended to include the `{{
variable }}` string.

(!includes/error-message.mdx!)
